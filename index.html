                        <h1>The Tip On the "Tip" of your fingers</h1>
                        <p>Tipping is more than acknowledging good service. Itâ€™s about making a living. Service employees in the United States rely on tips to supplement their salaries. Customers tip the minimum because they feel obligated by social norms, but customers will tip more if they like the people who serve them. The key to receiving higher tips is to create an environment that predisposes customers to be more generous.
                                Some customers want to be pampered, some customers require minimal service, and some customers just want to be left alone to enjoy their expirience. Everything else is in TIPSEASE's hands.
